# Random Variable Explorer
An interactive web application for exploring random variables, sample spaces, and probability distributions.

## Features
- Intuitive visualization of sample spaces and probability distributions
- Real-time updates as you manipulate the sample space or change functions
- Custom function input for exploring various random variable transformations
- Smooth animations for an engaging user experience

## How It Works
1. **Sample Space**: Visualized as colored circles, each representing an element in the space.
2. **Random Variable Function**: Choose from preset functions or input your own custom function
3. **Probability Distribution**: Dynamically updated bar chart showing the probability distribution of the random variable.

## Usage
1. Add elements to the sample space using the input field or generate a random sample.
2. Select a function from the dropdown or input a custom function (e.g., `x^2-2x+1`)
3. Notice how the probability distribution changes in real-time.
